# dicer

## Simple dice simulation done with vuejs. 
You can choose the number of dice you want to add to the dicing field and the number of sides per dice. At the time only d6 and d20 are implemented but feel free to create svgs for other type of dice (d4, d8, d12, ...). The simulator also allows you to deselect and select dice by clicking on them. With this feature you can simulate taking dice out of your next roll to save for later. This was a feature I was missing on every other dicing website.

You can check it out at [dicer.pro](http://dicer.pro).
